# Deferred work

In-tree issue tracker: known divergences, limitations, and parked work that is
deliberately out of scope for the PR that discovered it. Entries move out when
fixed (delete the entry in the fixing PR) or when they graduate to a GitHub
issue because someone outside the repo needs the link.

## git status — divergences from git

Found by the PR #23 cross-model review (deepseek-v4-pro C-series); each needs a
fixture asserted against real `git status --porcelain` before fixing.

- **C1 — staged half, file↔dir typechange reports `A` not `T`.** HEAD tree
  entries are dropped early in `stage_the_index` (status.rs), so the
  comparison never sees the old class.
- **C2 — unstaged half, file→dir reports `Typechange`.** git reports ` D` for
  the file plus `??` for the directory's contents.
- **C3 — ignored directory containing tracked files.** Emitted as `!!` and not
  descended; git descends (tracked wins over ignore), reports the tracked
  files' states, and never emits the directory itself.

## git status — known limitations (accepted for the read profile)

- **C5 — config-driven comparison ignored, by design.** `core.autocrlf`,
  `core.fileMode`, `core.ignorecase` are not consulted; hosts relying on them
  can see spurious `M`/`D`. We are hermetic by design — revisit only if
  real-world noise shows up.
- **C6 — submodule dirty content never reported.** Gitlinks compare by
  recorded OID only; a dirty or ahead submodule worktree is invisible (matches
  the intent comment in `unstage_the_worktree`).
- **R3 — verify gix-worktree `Stack` under sparse/skip-worktree.** Confirm the
  ignore `Stack` doesn't persist an id-mapping that misbehaves with sparse
  checkout or skip-worktree bits — needs a fixture or an upstream source check.

## git status — needs a probe

- **G4 — `guard_alternates` may be a 1-bit existence oracle (unconfirmed).**
  A repository with a relative `objects/info/alternates` entry pointing outside
  the mount is refused by `contain` (exit 4) when the target exists. The open
  question is what `gix_odb::alternate::resolve` does when the target does *not*
  exist: git's native behavior is to silently drop a broken alternate, and if
  gix does the same, `contain` is never reached and the store opens (exit 0) —
  the same outside-vs-nonexistent split G2 had. Needs a probe against
  `gix_odb::alternate::resolve` (raised by gemini-pro in the PR #23 re-review;
  behavioral, do not reason it out — build the fixture).

## git log — known limitations (accepted for the read profile)

- **L1 — `--stat` does not detect renames.** A renamed file is counted as one
  deletion plus one addition, so `files` is 2 and the line counts are the whole
  file twice. `status` has exact-match rename pairing and `log` does not,
  because the tree comparison here is per-commit and pairing would need the same
  oid-reappearance pass run against every commit walked. Git's own default
  (`git log --stat` without `-M`) also does not detect renames, so this matches
  the tool an agent is comparing against — but it is a divergence from `status`
  within our own surface, which is the part worth closing. Revisit when PR 5
  (`diff`) factors the rename pairing out of `status`.

- **L2 — a filtered `log` walks history rather than stopping at `--limit`.**
  No filter (`--author`, `--path`, a date window) is sorted along ancestry, so
  the walk cannot stop when it has enough matches — it stops when it has enough
  matches *or* has examined `MAX_COMMITS_EXAMINED` (100k) commits. On a large
  repository an unmatched filter therefore pays a full-history walk and reports
  `truncated: true`. Correct and bounded, but a commit-graph-backed date cutoff
  (`gix-traverse`'s `ByCommitTimeCutoff`) would make the date case much cheaper.
  Not worth the complexity until a real repository makes it hurt.

- **L4 — `@` is not accepted as a synonym for `HEAD`.** Git takes bare `@`
  wherever it takes `HEAD`. `resolve_commit` does not: `@` is not a valid ref
  name, is not hex, and so exits 1 "does not name a commit". That is a refusal,
  not a wrong answer — a probe over the whole grammar (`@`, `HEAD@`, `^{}`,
  `-`, `HEAD~0`, `HEAD^^^`, `HEAD~2~3`, `HEAD~-1`, `HEAD~1x`, oversized `~N`,
  trailing whitespace, empty) found no input that resolves to a *surprising*
  commit, which is the property that matters. But an agent that types `@` gets
  a confusing error rather than the log it wanted. Either accept it as an alias
  or name it in `unsupported_revspec` so the error says "use HEAD".

- **L3 — `--stat` line counts read whole blobs.** Counting lines needs both
  sides of every changed file in memory, bounded per blob by the embedder's
  `max_blob_bytes` but not in aggregate across a commit. A commit touching very
  many just-under-cap files is a large transient allocation. The row cap bounds
  commits, not bytes per commit.

## kaish seams — for the write profiles

- **S1 — an out-of-tree tool cannot name kaish's effect ids type-safely.**
  `ToolSchema::operations` (kaish 0.14.0) carries the dotted effect ids a tool
  declares, so an embedder learns `rm` removes a path without recognizing the
  name. The ids themselves live in `KernelOperation` (`kaish-kernel/src/
  operation.rs`), and `kaish-tools-git` deliberately does not depend on
  `kaish-kernel` — that independence is the honest-embedder posture. So when
  the write profiles land we would either hardcode strings that must match the
  kernel's by convention, or ask kaish to move the id constants down into
  `kaish-types` where the out-of-tree contract lives. The second is the kaish PR
  to open, and it is the AGENTS.md pattern exactly: a seam that does not exist
  yet, fixed upstream rather than worked around.

  **Nothing to do for the read profile** — `operations` is documented as
  "empty for a tool with no destructive effect", and every kaish builtin that
  declares one is destructive (`write`, `mv`, `cp`, `dd`, `rm`, `patch`, `tee`,
  `sed`). A read-only git tool correctly declares none, so today's empty vector
  is the right answer rather than an omission.

## Crate-wide — confirmed by probe, own PR (Amy, 2026-08-13)

Both found by the PR 3 cross-model review and then **probed**, not reasoned
about. Neither is introduced by `log`; both predate it and affect every verb,
so they get a focused PR of their own rather than riding along with a new verb.

- **X1 — the `.git` file's `gitdir:` line is a 1-bit host-existence oracle.**
  This is the G2 shape again, in the one place the earlier round did not reach.
  A `.git` *file* inside the mount naming a git dir outside it splits by whether
  the outside path exists on the host:

  | `gitdir:` target | result |
  |---|---|
  | exists | exit 4, `EscapesMount` |
  | absent | exit 1, `NotARepository` |

  Probed both ways with a fixture mounting a worktree whose `.git` file points
  outside. The cause is `repo.rs:184`: `canonicalize` failing on a
  repository-controlled `git_dir` folds into `NotARepository`, while resolving
  outside the ceiling falls through to the `EscapesMount` branch below. An
  attacker who controls a repository reads one bit about arbitrary host paths,
  one probe at a time.

  Fix shape: the same treatment `contain` and `open_leaf` already have — fold
  "does not resolve" and "resolves outside" into one non-echoing exit-4, so the
  refusal depends only on what the attacker already knows. Needs a fail-first
  probe for both cases, like the G2 fix.

- **X2 — positional arguments are silently swallowed, so the tool answers a
  different question.** `git log side` returns **exit 0** with `rev: "HEAD"`:
  the branch name lands in the hidden `operands` sink that every verb carries
  ("Validation-only sink… Read nothing off this field") and is discarded. An
  agent asking for a branch's history gets the current branch's, confidently,
  and concludes the branch is empty. `git status src/` has the same shape, and
  `info` the same sink.

  Probed directly: a two-branch fixture, `log side`, exit 0, one commit, HEAD's.

  **Amy's call (2026-08-13): accept them as git does** — a positional binds
  `--rev`, and positionals after `--` bind `--path`. That is real design across
  `info`/`status`/`log` and the `to_argv` convention the sink exists to satisfy,
  which is why it is its own PR. Until then every verb can silently answer the
  wrong question, which makes this the more dangerous of the two in daily use.

## Upstream

- **R4 — unbounded recursion decoding the index cache-tree (gix-index).**
  `gix_index::extension::tree::decode::one_recursive` (gix-index 0.54.0,
  `src/extension/tree/decode.rs:36`) recurses once per subtree of the `TREE`
  extension with no depth bound, so a `.git/index` carrying a deep enough
  cache-tree aborts the process with a stack overflow. Confirmed by probe
  while capping our own tree walk: a 1200-level chain, which `git write-tree`
  produces on request, overflows a 2 MiB thread inside `ReadRepo::open_index`
  — before any kaish-git code sees a tree. Backtrace is ~1200 frames of
  `one_recursive`.

  We cannot close this from here. `gix_index::decode::Options` carries no way
  to skip or bound the extension (`thread_limit`,
  `min_extension_block_in_bytes_for_threading`, `expected_checksum`,
  `alloc_limit_bytes`), and `alloc_limit_bytes` does not help: it bounds the
  per-node subtree allocation, while the hostile shape is one subtree per
  level. Our own `MAX_TREE_DEPTH` bounds `flatten_subtree` and nothing else,
  so `a_tree_deeper_than_the_cap_is_refused` deletes the index to keep its
  assertion pointed at our recursion.

  Next step is a gitoxide issue plus a depth limit in `one_recursive`. Until
  then a hostile index can crash any embedder of this crate.
