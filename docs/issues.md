# Deferred work

In-tree issue tracker: known divergences, limitations, and parked work that is
deliberately out of scope for the PR that discovered it. Entries move out when
fixed (delete the entry in the fixing PR) or when they graduate to a GitHub
issue because someone outside the repo needs the link.

## git status — divergences from git

Found by the PR #23 cross-model review (deepseek-v4-pro C-series); each needs a
fixture asserted against real `git status --porcelain` before fixing.

- **C1 — staged half, file↔dir typechange reports `A` not `T`.** HEAD tree
  entries are dropped early in `stage_the_index` (status.rs), so the
  comparison never sees the old class.
- **C2 — unstaged half, file→dir reports `Typechange`.** git reports ` D` for
  the file plus `??` for the directory's contents.
- **C3 — ignored directory containing tracked files.** Emitted as `!!` and not
  descended; git descends (tracked wins over ignore), reports the tracked
  files' states, and never emits the directory itself.

## git status — known limitations (accepted for the read profile)

- **C5 — config-driven comparison ignored, by design.** `core.autocrlf`,
  `core.fileMode`, `core.ignorecase` are not consulted; hosts relying on them
  can see spurious `M`/`D`. We are hermetic by design — revisit only if
  real-world noise shows up.
- **C6 — submodule dirty content never reported.** Gitlinks compare by
  recorded OID only; a dirty or ahead submodule worktree is invisible (matches
  the intent comment in `unstage_the_worktree`).
- **R3 — verify gix-worktree `Stack` under sparse/skip-worktree.** Confirm the
  ignore `Stack` doesn't persist an id-mapping that misbehaves with sparse
  checkout or skip-worktree bits — needs a fixture or an upstream source check.
